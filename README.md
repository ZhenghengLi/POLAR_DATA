# POLAR_RawData_Decode_Project
This project is started at Sep 19, 2015 after I come to IHEP and proposed to do the decoding of the raw data produced from POLAR detector and all the latter related science analysis. C++ is the main language and the ROOT library is used. The raw data will be transformed and stored to x.root files. Monte Carlo simulation using Geant4 will also be included to this project because the data analysis is very dependent to the result of simulation.

This project is now under developing ...
